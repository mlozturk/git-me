## Re-writing a Pushed Commit
In Turkish, there's a saying "aman dilemek", which means to plead or beg for something.  
Just like we might beg for forgiveness for a mistake, in Git, we "amend" our last bad commit messages to make them right.
Modify the last commit's message:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit msg"
```
then force push :
```bash
git push origin <branch-name> --force
```
